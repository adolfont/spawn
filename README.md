# Spawn

**Actor Mesh Framework**

## Overview

Spawn is based on the sidecar proxy pattern to provide a multi-language Actor Model framework.
Spawn's technology stack on top of BEAM VM (Erlang's virtual machine) provides support for different languages from its native Actor model.

Spawn is made up of the following components:

* A semantic protocol based on Protocol Buffers
* A Sidecar Proxy written in Elixir that implements this protocol.
* Support libraries in different programming languages.
